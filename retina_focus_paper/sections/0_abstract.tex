\textit{
    Nowadays, a device which can capture an image in high resolution such as 8K or 16K becomes more popular.
    Besides, face detection is always an attractive problem for researcher because of its importance in many downstream application.
    Lots of incredible achievements have been published recent years to solve face detection problem, but these models work on quite low resolution images.
    The development in the resolution of image requires a machine learning model processes a high resolution image fast with an optimized memory usage.
    Moreover, there are few open datasets with facial bounding boxes consists high resolution images.
    To overcome the above problems, in this paper, we present several contributions:
    (1) We propose RetinaFocus - a novel face detector which can run effectively on 4K resolution image.
    (2) We share a new idea to create a high resolution validation subset of WIDER FACE dataset to benchmark model performance both accuracy and speed.
    % Source code for reproducing the experiments is publicly available at: \url{https://github.com/pixta-dev/labteam}
